- [Week 06](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/developer/week06-project04-databases/learning-outcomes/)

Make sure to record evidence of your processes. You can use code snippets, screenshots or any other material to support your answers.

Do not fill in the feedback section. The Founders and Coders team will update this with feedback on your progress.

## Assessment
 ### 1. Show evidence of some of the learning outcomes you have achieved this week.
 
> This week was all about Terraform for me. I've never written in Terraform, and as it is a part of my tech stack with my employer, I wanted  to delve into it and understand its uses and how I would implement it into my project.
> I created both environments for the backend and frontend with Terraform. This means my EC2 instance and my S3 bucket were created completely and exclusively with Terraform.
> I didn't want to ever go onto AWS and fiddle with the configurations and therefore was determined to complete it through Terraform.

 ### 2. Show an example of some of the learning outcomes you have struggled with and/or would like to re-visit.
> I definitely need to revisit why my frontend won't deploy onto the s3.
> Whenever I open my Endpoint URL, it flickers and nothing opens up.
> I need to investigate whether it's due to HTTPS not being used or whether my files have been uploaded correctly.

Looks like you are building solid foundations on Terraform, it is not an easy topic so dont worry if it feels hard at the beggining.
Your FE deployment problem looks more like a building problem, maybe the typescript config file is wrong
