Assessment
1. Show evidence of some of the learning outcomes you have achieved this week.

spun up an EC2 instance and deployed our agency app through it.
I created the Contact Us page for our agency website using HTML, CSS and JS.
I learned how to SSH into my EC2 instance and install all necessary plugins in the instance. 



3. Show an example of some of the learning outcomes you have struggled with and/or would like to re-visit.

At first, I struggled to SSH into the instance I created. My command line kept on hanging, and it prompted me to keep checking and re-checking my security groups, and the general settings of the instance itself. I eventually got through it and I'm with the progress.

 I also struggled with one of the functions I created on my Contact Us page. The function created was made to take the 'name' from the URL once it was clicked on in the About Us page, and automatically have it as a default option in our dropdown. It was particularly hard as I didn't know how to go about it, what methods to use etc. But with little research, we got there.

[What went well]

You mention some very interesting topics you've been working on. It is great that, apart from the website building itself, you looked for some more advanced deployment to increase your DevOps knowledge.

[Even better if]

It would be good to add brief code snippets, diagrams or screenshots to support this documentation. You can go more specific on the struggles or pieces of code that were problematic or those you want to showcase. This progress log should be something that you can check in the future whenever you face the same or similar difficulties.
